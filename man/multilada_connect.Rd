\title{Connect to a Multilada database}
\usage{
multilada_connect(database = NULL, prompt = "Database")
}
\arguments{
\item{database}{A \code{character}. If provided, the function tries to retrieve credentials
saved by that name in the system-based store. If not found, it asks
for them securely and saves them in the store by that name.
If \code{database = NULL} (default), the function only asks for credentials in a secure way
and doesn't try to store them.}

\item{prompt}{A \code{character}, the prefix to a prompt displayed, when the
function needs to ask for credentials. It defaults to "Database" and
the credentials are "host", "port", "name", "username", and "password",
which means the prompts would be "Database host: " etc.}
}
\value{
An object returned by \link[DBI:dbConnect]{DBI::dbConnect}.

we want to connect to and as such is
needed by several our functions \link{to be linked here}.
